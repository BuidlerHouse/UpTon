### Product Introduction and Direction
upTon is a Telegram mini app built on the TON ecosystem, designed to bring a secure, fair, and seamless token experience to users. It enhances the safety of token launches by ensuring that each token follows a fair-launch process, preventing rug pulls and ensuring long-term trust in the ecosystem.

### How It Works
1. **Pick a Token**: Browse through a selection of tokens on upTon, each launched fairly without presale or team allocations.
2. **Buy on the Bonding Curve**: Purchase your chosen token directly on the bonding curve, ensuring predictable pricing for each transaction.
3. **Sell Anytime**: Sell your tokens whenever you like to lock in profits or mitigate losses.
4. **Market Cap Milestone**: Once the token's market cap hits $45k, the token reaches its next phase.
5. **Liquidity Added & Burned**: $10k of liquidity is deposited into Raydium and burned for long-term stability.

### How to Start a New Coin on upTon
1. **Create Token**: Choose a name, symbol, and initial supply for your new coin.
2. **Fair-Launch Setup**: No presales or team allocationsâ€”everyone starts on equal footing.
3. **Deploy on Bonding Curve**: Launch your token, allowing users to buy directly on the bonding curve.
4. **Set Market Cap Goal**: Choose a market cap target (e.g., $69k) for liquidity locking.
5. **Lock & Burn Liquidity**: Once the target is reached, $12k liquidity is locked and burned.

Your token is now live and ready to grow!
